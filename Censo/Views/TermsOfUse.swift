IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THE TOU ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE AUTHORIZED AND LAWFULLY ABLE TO BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THE TOU, IN WHICH CASE THE TERM “YOU” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE TOU, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE, AND YOU MUST UNINSTALL ANY COMPONENTS OF THE SERVICE FROM ANY DEVICE WITHIN YOUR CUSTODY OR CONTROL.</p> <p>You represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is greater, and of legal age to form a binding contract. You further represent and warrant that you are not a person barred from accessing or using the Service under the laws of your country of residence or any other applicable jurisdiction.</p> <p><strong>2. OTHER AGREEMENTS AND TERMS</strong><br>
In addition to the TOU, your access to and use of the Service are further subject to the Censo Privacy Policy and any usage or other policies relating to the Service posted or otherwise made available to you by Censo, including any purchase, subscription or other similar terms posted within the Service (the Privacy Policy and any such usage or other policies, collectively, <strong>“Additional Terms”</strong>).

In registering for the Service, you agree to: (i) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (the <strong>“Registration Data”</strong>); and (ii) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Censo reasonably suspects that you have done so, Censo may suspend or terminate your account.</p> <p>You may not share your account or password with anyone. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account, whether or not you authorized the particular use, and regardless of your knowledge of such use. Upon becoming aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your account or password or any other similar breach of security, you shall promptly notify Censo.</p> <p>to suspend or terminate your account, with or without notice to you, and delete Your Content.</p> <p><strong>4. FEES AND TAXES</strong><br>
You are solely responsible for any data, usage and other charges assessed by mobile, cable, internet or other communications services providers for your access to and use of the Service. Some features of the Service are free to use, but fees may apply for subscriptions, premium features and other components, such as fees charged on token swaps that you execute on third-party exchanges through use of the Service. If there is a fee listed for any portion of the Service, by accessing or using that portion, you agree to pay the fee. Censo reserves the right to change such fees at any time in its sole discretion. Your access to the Service may be suspended or terminated if you do not make payment in full when due.</p> <p>You may incur fees from third parties relating to access to or use of Third-Party Materials (defined in Section 9). For example, you may be charged fees via dApps and other third-party platforms, sites or services to which you enable access to your Wallet (defined in Section (a) ) or through which you engage in transactions involving Digital Assets using the Service. Third party fees are not charged by Censo or paid to Censo. You, not Censo, are solely responsible for payment of any applicable third-party fees.</p> <p>Any and all amounts payable hereunder by you are exclusive of any value-added, sales, use, excise or other similar taxes (collectively, <strong>“Taxes”</strong>). You are solely responsible for paying all applicable Taxes, except for any Taxes based upon Censo’s net income. If Censo has the legal obligation to collect any Taxes, you shall reimburse Censo upon invoice by Censo. Taxes, if applicable, are calculated based on the information you provide and the applicable rate at the time of your monthly charge.</p> <p><strong>5. GRANT OF RIGHTS</strong><br>
Censo grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable right to: (i) access and view pages within the Service; (ii) access and use any online software, application and other similar component within the Service, to the extent that the Service provides you with access to or use of such component, but only in the form made accessible by Censo within the Service; and (iii) install, run and operate mobile applications that Censo makes available for accessing or using the Service (each a, <strong>“Mobile App”</strong>) on a mobile device that you own or control, but only in executable, machine-readable, object code form.</p> <p>All rights granted to you under the TOU are subject to your compliance with the TOU, including all Additional Terms, in all material respects.</p> <p><strong>6. VAULT AND WALLETS</strong><br>
Censo makes available a vault app or function as part of the Service that provides access to and use of individual vaults (each, a <strong>“Vault”</strong>). Censo also makes available a wallet app or function as part of the Service that provides access to and use of individual wallets (each, a <strong>“Wallet”</strong>) for you to: (i) store tokens, cryptocurrencies and other crypto or blockchain-based digital assets (collectively, <strong>“Digital Assets”</strong>); (ii) link to decentralized applications, including decentralized exchanges (collectively, <strong>“dApps”</strong>); and (iii) engage in Digital Asset transactions on a peer-to- peer basis as facilitated by dApps. You may store and manage a Wallet or collection of Wallets within a Vault.</p> <p>To access your Wallet or Vault, you will need to install and have access to the Censo security app on a mobile device (the <strong>“Censo Security App”</strong>). If you lose access to the mobile device on which your Censo Security App runs (whether through loss or destruction of the device or other causes), you will need to use a recovery password (the <strong>“Recovery Password”</strong>) to access any Digital Assets stored in your Wallet or Vault. When you register for the Service, the Recovery Password is automatically placed in your mobile device's keychain by default. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your keychain containing the Recovery Password is properly backed up, including through the cloud as appropriate. If you lose your Recovery Password, you may not be able to access the Digital Assets stored in your Wallet or Vault. Censo does not store and is not responsible for the security of your Recovery Password. You are solely responsible for any losses, including loss of Digital Assets, arising from your failure to keep, remember or safeguard your Recovery Password.</p> <p>If you have administrative control over a Vault or Wallet, the Service may allow you to delegate access to the Vault or Wallet to other users of the Service (each, a <strong>“Delegate”</strong>). If you give a Delegate access to a Vault or Wallet, you do so at your own risk. Censo undertakes no liability for any acts or omissions of a Delegate in connection with any Vault or Wallet to which you have given the Delegate access, including any transactions involving such Vault or Wallet executed by the Delegate and any loss of Digital Assets or other losses involving such Vault or Wallet incurred by the Delegate.</p> <p>If you obtain access to or use of a Vault or Wallet, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have proper authorization from all parties with a legal interest in the Vault or Wallet to access and use the Vault or Wallet; and (ii) any acts or omissions by you with respect to the Vault or Wallet have been properly authorized by all parties with a legal interest in the Vault or Wallet.</p> <p><strong>7.

If any Mobile App is downloaded by you from the Apple Inc. (<strong>“Apple”</strong>) App Store (each, an <strong>“iOS Mobile App”</strong>), the right set forth in Section (a) (iii) with respect to such iOS Mobile App is further subject to your compliance in all material respects with the terms and conditions of the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service.</p> <p>With respect to any iOS Mobile App, you and Censo acknowledge and agree that the TOU is concluded between you and Censo only, and not with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for iOS Mobile Apps and the contents thereof. Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to iOS Mobile Apps. Censo, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims from you or any third party relating to iOS Mobile Apps or your possession and/or use of iOS Mobile Apps, including product liability claims, any claim that iOS Mobile Apps fail to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, and claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. Apple and Apple's subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of the TOU with respect to iOS Mobile Apps, and Apple shall have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the TOU against you as a third-party beneficiary hereof with respect to iOS Mobile Apps. Subject to Section 16, Censo, not Apple, shall be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any intellectual property infringement claim attributable to iOS Mobile Apps.</p> <p><strong>8.

EXTERNAL MATERIALS AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</strong><br>

Censo does not endorse and is not responsible for any content, advertising, products, services or other materials on or available through such sites or resources (<strong>“External Materials”</strong>). External Materials include dApps and other third- party platforms, sites or services to which you enable access to your Wallet or Vault or through which you engage in transactions involving Digital Assets using the Service. External Materials are subject to different terms of use and privacy policies. You are responsible for reviewing and complying with such terms of use and privacy policies.</p> <p><strong>10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONTENT</strong><br>

GENERAL PROVISIONS</strong><br>
The TOU (together with the Additional Terms) constitutes the entire agreement between you and Censo concerning your access to and use of the Service. It supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral or written negotiations and agreements between you and Censo with respect to such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between or among the TOU and any Additional Terms, the TOU will take precedence and govern. The TOU may not be amended by you except in a writing executed by you and an authorized representative of Censo. For the purposes of the TOU, the words “such as,” “include,” “includes” and “including” will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” You may not assign or delegate any right or obligation under the TOU without the prior written consent of Censo. Censo may assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations under the TOU without your consent. The failure of Censo to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOU will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOU is held to be invalid or unenforceable under Applicable Law, then such provision will be construed, limited, modified or, if necessary, severed to the extent necessary to eliminate its invalidity or unenforceability, without in any way affecting the remaining parts of the TOU. Except with respect to your obligation to pay fees when due, any prevention of or delay in performance by Censo hereunder due to any act of god, fire, casualty, flood, war, strike, lock out, failure of public utilities, injunction or any act, exercise, assertion or requirement of any governmental entity, epidemic, pandemic, public health crisis, destruction of production facilities, insurrection or any other cause beyond Censo's reasonable control will excuse the performance of its obligations for a period equal to the duration of any such prevention or delay.</p></div></main> <footer><div class="dark-bkg" data-v-0175825e><div class="container mx-auto py-5 md:py-24 flex flex-col md:flex-row" data-v-0175825e><div class="md:w-1/4 md:border-r-[1px] md:border-white order-last md:order-first" data-v-0175825e><div class="pt-3 md:pr-24 md:mb-96 text-sm" data-v-0175825e>Censo, Inc.<br>111 Congress Ave, Suite 500<br>Austin, TX 78704<br>USA</div> <div class="pt-5 md:pt-24 text-sm" data-v-0175825e>All rights reserved.<br>Copyright ©2023 Censo, Inc.</div></div>
